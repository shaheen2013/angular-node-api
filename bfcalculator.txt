This project involves 4 steps to be done with PhP scripts & MySQL:

1) Create a user registration form on my hosted server where users fill in: name, email, password, age, sexe, weight and height amd fitness (scale 1-5). The data should be added to a MySQL database which has already been created

2) Create a user login page. On my website there are already 2 webpages, make sure they are only available after logging in.

3) These 2 webpages are webforms where users fill in values which are already saved to the MySQL database. Make sure the user ID is tagged to the data saved by these webforms in MySQL.

4) Create a page for users who forgot their password, where they can create a new one.
[8/23/17, 6:42:28 PM] Md. Shahinur Rahman: Second, do you work with Git? For instance through Bitbucket (is free)?
[8/23/17, 6:42:44 PM] Md. Shahinur Rahman: It currently is not/partly in codeigniter.
I can give you access to what there is now.

Than you can say to me what you can do
[8/23/17, 6:42:55 PM] Md. Shahinur Rahman: I currently have 2 ´webforms´. In both webforms, users add figures or upload an excel file. The input is sent to a MySQL database
[8/23/17, 6:43:04 PM] Md. Shahinur Rahman: So it is important that when users are registered and logged in and use these webforms, that the webforms recognize the user and add this users user_ID to the upload
